        Open exercise: in your day-to-day coding, start paying more attention to the signatures of the functions you write and consume. Does the order of arguments make sense; that is, do they go from general to specific? Is there some argument that you always invoke with the same value, so that you could partially apply it? Do you sometimes write similar variations of the same code, and could these be generalized into a parameterized function?
